# Task Description
Implement AI response in chat.py using Agno framework and optimize llm.py for general chat integration with conversation history.

# Project Overview
FastAPI-based chat application with Agno integration for AI responses, requiring history incorporation and minimal code changes.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
[Code investigation results: Identified placeholder AI response in chat.py and Agno utilities in llm.py. Need to integrate history and optimize for DRY, minimal code.]

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)
[Approaches discussed: Adapt chat_complete for history, create general agent if needed, mock mentions, handle errors without fallbacks.]

# Implementation Plan (Generated by PLAN mode)
[Final checklist including detailed steps, file paths, function signatures, etc.]
Implementation Checklist:
1. Optimize `app/utils/llm.py` by adding a function to fetch and format conversation history from the database as a list of `Message` objects for Agno.
2. Enhance `chat_complete` in `app/utils/llm.py` to accept conversation history as an optional parameter and incorporate it into the message sequence for Agno.
3. Mock mention handling in `app/utils/llm.py` by including a placeholder in the system prompt or response, simulating vector ID context without real Qdrant integration.
4. Update `app/api/endpoints/chat.py` to fetch conversation history using the new function from `llm.py` before calling the enhanced `chat_complete`.
5. Replace the placeholder AI response in `send_chat_message_endpoint` with a call to `chat_complete`, passing the formatted history.
6. Implement error handling in `send_chat_message_endpoint` to catch Agno failures and return only the user message, aligning with no fallback requirement.
7. Ensure all changes maintain async compatibility and use existing Redis broadcasting for the AI response.

# Task Progress (Appended by EXECUTE mode after each step completion)
*   [2023-10-03T12:00:00Z]
    *   Step: 1. Optimize `app/utils/llm.py` by adding a function to fetch and format conversation history from the database as a list of `Message` objects for Agno.
    *   Modifications: Added `fetch_conversation_history` function to `app/utils/llm.py`; enhanced `chat_complete` to accept history parameter.
    *   Change Summary: Integrated history fetching and formatting for Agno compatibility.
    *   Reason: Executing plan step 1.
    *   Blockers: None.
    *   User Confirmation Status: Pending Confirmation
